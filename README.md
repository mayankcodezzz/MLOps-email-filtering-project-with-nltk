## The "MLOps Email Filtering Project with NLTK" is a machine learning initiative aimed at developing an efficient email classification system. By leveraging the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and incorporating MLOps practices, the project ensures a streamlined and reproducible workflow.

Key Features:

- Data Version Control (DVC): Utilizes DVC to manage datasets and model versions, ensuring consistency and traceability throughout the project lifecycle.

- Experiment Tracking with DVCLive: Integrates DVCLive to monitor and log metrics during model training, providing real-time insights into performance.

- Text Processing with NLTK: Employs NLTK for comprehensive text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming or lemmatization, to prepare email data for classification.

- Model Development and Training: Defines a robust pipeline for training machine learning models, incorporating hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance.

- Deployment and Integration: Prepares the model for deployment, ensuring it can be integrated into existing systems for real-time email classification.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of applying MLOps principles to an email filtering system, demonstrating best practices in version control, experiment tracking, and model deployment.
